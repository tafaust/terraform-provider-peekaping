     type = "http"
     config = jsonencode({
       url = "https://example.com"

data "peekaping_monitor" "existing" {

```

## Examples

See the [examples directory](../examples/) for comprehensive usage examples:

- [Simple Example](../examples/simple/) - Basic monitoring setup
- [Comprehensive Example](../examples/comprehensive/) - Full-featured monitoring
- [Full Lifecycle Example](../examples/full-lifecycle/) - Create, update, delete workflow
- [Field Testing Example](../examples/test_field_names/) - Comprehensive field testing

## Important Notes

### Computed Fields

Some fields are computed by the provider and cannot be set directly:

- `active` (notifications and maintenance)
- `status` (monitors)
- `created_at` (monitors)
- `updated_at` (monitors)

### JSON Configuration

Monitor and notification configurations must be valid JSON. Use `jsonencode()` for proper formatting:

```hcl
config = jsonencode({
  url    = "https://example.com"
  method = "GET"
  headers = {
    "User-Agent" = "Terraform-Provider-Peekaping"
  }
})
```

### State Management

The provider uses state as ground truth to handle API inconsistencies, ensuring reliable Terraform operations.
