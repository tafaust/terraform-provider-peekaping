```bash
export PEEKAPING_ENDPOINT="https://api.peekaping.com"
export PEEKAPING_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
export PEEKAPING_PASSWORD="your-password"
export PEEKAPING_TOKEN="your-2fa-token"  # Optional
```

## Resource Types

The provider supports the following resource types:

- **`peekaping_monitor`**: HTTP, TCP, Ping, DNS, and other monitor types
